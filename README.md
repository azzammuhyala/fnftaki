# FNF Mod - Friday Night Fever - only with Taki and Demon Fever!!
I just made Taki VS Demon Fever using PyScript and PyGame library. This game is quite simple, with only four songs and
is ready to play without a main menu. If your device is quite low-end, i'm sure you won't even be able to reach 24 FPS
lol. PyScript runs on top of Python, which is quite slow and heavy for that.

## Requirements
- Python (above `3.10`)
- PyScript `pip install pyscript-programming-language` (above `1.10.3`)
- PyGame `pip install pygame` or `pip install pygame-ce`

## Run
Execute this command (run the file `main.py` with pyscript `interpreter`):
```sh
python -m pyscript main.py
```
